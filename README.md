This is merely an alternative version for 200 Lounge of the [prismillon statsoverlay](https://github.com/prismillon/statsoverlay) which neatly displays rank and mmr of the user

# Usage
#### When opening the Link to the Website [nanewtech.github.io/statsoverlay200](https://nanewtech.github.io/statsoverlay200/) you will see this exact page

As mentioned in the screenshot, you should now add your **200 Lounge** username to the end of the link in the following format

```
nanewtech.github.io/statsoverlay200/?name=<YOUR_LOUNGE_NAME_HERE>
```
When you have added your username enter the page and it will look something like this:

To now add this to your stream open OBS (or any other streaming software with similar capabilities) and add a browser source to the scene.
the browser source should look something like this:

# Difference

## Prismillion statsoverlay
#### *The original prismillon statsoverlay displays your *150 lounge** **rank, mmr and gain/loss from the last mogi** dynamically

## statsoverlay200
#### *Whereas this version of the statsoverlay displays your* ***200 Lounge rank and mmr*** dynamically

#### This is because the 200 Lounge API is significantly more limited than the 150 Lounge API for gathering user information
